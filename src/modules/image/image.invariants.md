# Image preview — Invariants

Load-bearing rules for `src/modules/image/` (the `ImageDecoders` extension→decoder registry, the
dependency-free PNG decoder, the jpeg-js-backed JPEG decoder, the shared `ImageResample` seam, the
half-block cell renderer, the `ImageRenderers` graphics-tier ladder with its kitty/sixel encoders,
the `PixelImageMount` placement manager, and the memoised `ImagePreview` seam) and its editor mount
(the image + pixel branches in `src/modules/ui/RootView.ts`).
Stands on `project.invariants.md` (one-way data flow, cost tracks the observed set, seams are drawn at
the shared generator) and the ui rendering records. Prototype scope: non-interlaced 8-bit PNG and
baseline/progressive JPEG shown in the active editor buffer as truecolor half-block cells.

## Reality-based invariants

### A raster image renders as half-block cells sized to the pane

**Invariant:** If a truecolor cell can carry an independent foreground and background colour, then two
vertically-stacked pixels map to ONE cell — the glyph `▀` (U+2580 upper half block) whose foreground is
the TOP pixel and whose background is the BOTTOM pixel. A pane of `columns × rows` cells therefore shows
exactly `columns × (2·rows)` pixels; the image is box-downsampled to that subpixel grid with aspect
preserved (a subpixel is square when sampled `columns` wide × `2·rows` tall), alpha-composited over the
panel background, and centred with panel-background letterbox cells. This is a property of the terminal
cell, not of any one image format: every decoder produces straight-alpha RGBA and the renderer knows
nothing of PNG or JPEG.

**Scope:** the decoders behind the `ImageDecoders` registry (`PngDecoder`, `JpegDecoder` — each
bytes → `{width, height, rgba}`), `HalfBlockRenderer` (RGBA + `columns`/`rows`
+ panel background → `StyledText` of `▀` cells), and `ImagePreview` (decode + render memo). Not the
editor document model, which only supplies the active file path.

**Mechanism:** `PngDecoder.decode` un-filters scanlines (all five filters, Paeth included) and expands
colour types 0/2/3/6 at bit depth 8 to RGBA; `JpegDecoder.decode` wraps jpeg-js with `formatAsRGBA`
so JPEG lands in the identical contract shape. `HalfBlockRenderer.render` fits the source into a
`columns × (2·rows)` subpixel box by the tighter of the two scale ratios, box-averages source pixels per
subpixel, composites over the panel background, and emits one `fg(top)(bg(bottom)('▀'))` chunk per cell,
coalescing same-styled runs like the other pane renderers. `RootView.update` swaps the code body to this
`StyledText` when `workspace.activeFileIsImage`, leaving the gutter blank.

**Generates:** a recognizable image in the cell grid at twice the vertical resolution of a full-block;
aspect-correct letterboxing; a renderer that is a pure function of the decoded pixels and the pane size.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/image/HalfBlockRenderer.test.ts` (a 1×2 image maps top→fg, bottom→bg of one
`▀` cell; a wide image in a tall pane is letterboxed with panel-background cells; the fit never exceeds
the pane); `src/modules/image/PngDecoder.test.ts` (every filter + colour type round-trips);
`src/modules/image/JpegDecoder.test.ts` (jpeg-js round-trip: contract shape, colour bands within lossy
tolerance, opaque alpha); `scripts/smoke-image-preview.sh` drives the real app: opening
`/tmp/ivue-cart-dark.png` and a generated JPEG renders non-blank `▀` cells with many distinct
foreground/background colours (the JPEG's tricolour bands land as red/green/blue cell regions).

**Impossible if true:** an image cell whose glyph is not `▀`; a decoded image whose `rgba.length` is not
`width*height*4`; a preview that upscales past `columns × (2·rows)` or distorts aspect; a renderer that
inspects PNG or JPEG structure instead of the decoded RGBA.

## Chosen invariants

### A pixel tier places and deletes graphics explicitly

**Invariant:** If a graphics tier richer than half-block shows the preview, then every placement
is emitted through the renderer's serialized writer only when its placement key (tier, path,
fitted rect, background) changes — never per frame — and only after pending frames settle (the
blanked cells land first); every placement that has identity is deleted when replaced, when the
buffer stops being the previewed image, and in a delete-all sweep on app dispose, so no image can
outlive the app onto the user's shell; and the cells under the graphics render blank so frame
repaints never fight the image.

**Scope:** `PixelImageMount` (the only stateful piece: key, generation, placed id), the tier
encoders behind `ImageRenderers` (`KittyGraphics` — placement identity, explicit delete;
`SixelEncoder` — inert painted pixels whose honest cleanup is emitting nothing), and the pixel
branch + `onDispose` wiring in `RootView`. The half-block floor is out of scope — cells need no
placement management.

**Mechanism:** `PixelImageMount.sync` computes the fitted rect through `ImageResample.fitWithin`
and no-ops on an unchanged key (the key carries the fitted CELL rect AND the fitted PIXEL dims, so
a font-zoom that moves only the cell pixel size still re-places). The mount splits PENDING from
EMITTED state: the place payload is built eagerly, but the delete-previous half is computed AT
WRITE TIME from the emitted id, and the new id is committed only when its payload actually writes
— so a queued placement that a generation guard cancels never becomes the thing `clear()` deletes
(that was the orphaned-visible-image bug). `clear()` deletes the EMITTED placement immediately and
cancels in-flight places; `dispose()` clears then emits the encoder's removeAll sweep. Kitty payloads are ≤4096-byte base64 chunks with q=2 (the
terminal never answers into the input parser) and C=1 + cursor save/restore (the cursor never
moves). RootView blanks `codeBody` under any pixel tier and clears the mount on every non-image
frame.

**Generates:** flicker-free tier rendering above an unchanged half-block floor; a quit that
leaves the user's shell clean; per-frame cost of a string-key compare; encoders that stay pure
(all screen state lives in one mount).

**Evidence:** `src/modules/image/PixelImageMount.test.ts` (emit-once-per-key, settle-gated
emission, delete-before-replace, generation cancellation, clear/dispose sweeps, letterbox
centring); `src/modules/image/KittyGraphics.test.ts` (chunk ceiling, m= flags, round-trip,
delete commands); `src/modules/image/SixelEncoder.test.ts` (golden DCS outputs, palette scale,
band clipping, transparency compositing).

**Impossible if true:** a graphics payload emitted on a frame whose placement key did not change;
a kitty placement surviving buffer switch or app quit; a placement emitted before the frame that
blanks its cells; two encoders disagreeing about who owns screen state (any stateful encoder); a
base64 chunk over 4096 bytes.

### An image buffer replaces the code text and leaves other files untouched

**Invariant:** The active buffer is treated as an image purely by file extension, and the set of image
extensions lives in ONE place — the `ImageDecoders` registry (`.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg` today); ONLY a
registered extension makes the code body show the half-block preview instead of syntax-highlighted
text; every non-image file renders exactly as before (a non-image binary still hits the
`(binary file not shown)` guard), and a decode failure shows a friendly one-line message rather than
crashing. The image branch is additive — it reads the same viewport geometry and palette the editor
render uses and writes only the code body and gutter.

**Scope:** `ImageDecoders` (the extension registry), `Workspace.activeFileIsImage` (the routing that
asks it), the image branch in `RootView.update`, and `ImagePreview.render` (the decode-error fallback).
Not `PngDecoder`/`JpegDecoder`/`HalfBlockRenderer`, which are policy agnostic.

**Mechanism:** `Workspace.activeFileIsImage` mirrors `activeFileIsMarkdown` — false during a diff or with
no document, true when `ImageDecoders.supports(extname(path))` (case-folded inside the registry).
`RootView.update` computes it once and,
when true, sets the code body to `ImagePreview.render(path, columns, rows, palette.panel)` and blanks the
gutter; otherwise the unchanged editor render path runs. `ImagePreview` resolves the decoder from the
same registry by the path's extension, catches any decode error, and
returns a `Cannot preview this image` `StyledText`. Decode and render are single-slot memoised so the
per-frame cost is a map lookup, not a re-decode.

**Generates:** image preview with zero regression to text/markdown/diff rendering; a crash-proof preview;
a new raster format is one registry entry plus its decoder file — no routing edit, no second extension
list to keep in sync (this record stands on `project.invariants.md` "Seams are drawn at the shared
generator").

**Evidence:** `scripts/smoke-image-preview.sh` — after opening the PNG and the generated JPEG,
`activeFileIsImage` is true and
the pane is half-block cells; opening a `.ts` file next renders its source text (no `▀`), and the app
stays alive; a non-image `.bin` binary shows `(binary file not shown)`, never the preview;
`src/modules/image/ImageDecoders.test.ts` (registry answers, case-folding, null for non-image
extensions).

**Impossible if true:** a `.ts`/`.md` buffer rendered as half-block cells; a second image-extension
list outside `ImageDecoders`; an image decode error that
crashes the app; the image branch mutating anything but the code body and gutter; a per-frame re-decode
of the active image.
