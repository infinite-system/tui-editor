# LSP — Module Invariants

The language-intelligence subsystem: a plain JSON-RPC transport over a Bun subprocess, driven
by a reactive `LanguageClient`. This contract governs `src/modules/lsp/`. It stands on the root
`project.invariants.md` — in particular the reality invariants *Language and git tools are
separate failable processes*, *An async result can outlive the state it described*, *A text
position has several encodings*, and *A referenced resource stays alive*, and the chosen
invariants *The immediate layer never blocks the deferred layer*, *Async results are
revision-stamped and stale results discarded*, and *Cost tracks the actively observed set*.

Invariants are unnumbered — the name is the identifier, matched byte-for-byte by `// invariant:`
annotations. Chosen invariants stand on reality invariants, never the reverse.

## Reality-based invariants

### Byte streams do not preserve message boundaries

**Invariant:** If JSON-RPC messages are carried over a subprocess stdout pipe, then a single
read can split one message across chunks or coalesce several into one, so message boundaries
exist only in the `Content-Length` framing, never in the chunk boundaries.

**Scope:** All decoding of language-server output in `JsonRpc.push`. Not the encode side, which
controls its own framing.

**Renegotiable at:** the OS pipe / Bun stream layer — reality inside this module, fixed by how
byte streams work; no server or config makes a pipe message-preserving.

**Mechanism:** A pipe is a byte stream; the kernel and the reader deliver whatever bytes are
available when a read completes, indifferent to the sender's write boundaries. Only the
`Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n` header lets the decoder recover the original message boundaries.

**Generates:** The incremental `JsonRpc` decoder that accumulates bytes, scans for the header
terminator, reads exactly `Content-Length` body bytes, and loops for further complete messages
in the same buffer.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/JsonRpc.ts:110` (`push` accumulates then loops); `:128` (waits
until `bytes.byteLength >= bodyLength` before slicing a body); `:155` (`findHeaderEnd` scans the
buffer for `\r\n\r\n`).

**Impossible if true:** A decoder that assumes one read equals one message and either drops the
tail of a coalesced pair or emits a truncated body from a split chunk.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "split across two chunks"` and
`bun test src/modules/lsp -t "two messages in one chunk"`.

**Status:** provisional

### LSP positions cross through UTF-16

**Invariant:** If a text position is exchanged with a language server, then it is expressed in
UTF-16 code units on the wire, which do not coincide with the editor's grapheme columns, so a
conversion is required in each direction at the client boundary.

**Scope:** Every position/range sent to or received from the server: definition, references,
hover requests and their result ranges, and diagnostic ranges. Not the editor↔client mapping
above grapheme columns, which the main loop wires later.

**Renegotiable at:** the LSP protocol / server position-encoding negotiation — UTF-16 is the
spec default; a server that negotiates UTF-8 or UTF-32 would move the boundary, but the client
API stays UTF-16-derived.

**Mechanism:** Stands on *A text position has several encodings*. A JS string is UTF-16
internally, but a grapheme cluster (emoji, base+combining) can span several UTF-16 units, so the
client converts grapheme column → UTF-16 character before a request and UTF-16 character →
grapheme column when reading a result.

**Generates:** `toLspPosition` (grapheme prefix → UTF-16 length) and `fromLspPosition` (UTF-16
slice → grapheme count); the client API surfacing UTF-16-derived positions rather than raw
grapheme columns.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/LanguageClient.ts:636` (`toLspPosition` maps to `character` via
UTF-16 prefix length); `:644` (`fromLspPosition` maps a UTF-16 `character` back to a grapheme
column).

**Impossible if true:** A definition/hover/diagnostic that lands on the correct column for ASCII
text but drifts by the surrogate/cluster width once an emoji or combining mark precedes it.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "cross to the server as UTF-16"`.

**Status:** provisional

## Chosen invariants

### LSP activation follows semantic demand

**Invariant:** If no supported document is open and no semantic feature has been requested, then
no language-server subprocess is spawned; the server starts only on the first supported
`openDocument` or the first semantic request (definition, references, hover).

**Scope:** `LanguageClient` startup. A single lazily-created process/transport per client;
unsupported files never trigger a start.

**Mechanism:** Stands on *Language and git tools are separate failable processes* and *Cost
tracks the actively observed set*. Every entry point routes through `ensureStarted`, which spawns
the process on first demand and otherwise returns the in-flight/settled start; `openDocument`
returns early for unsupported paths before any activation.

**Generates:** The `ensureStarted`/`activate` gate; the process/transport factories invoked on
demand; the guarantee that a cold workspace holds no LSP subprocess.

**Rejected alternatives:** Spawning one server per project file at launch — costs a subprocess
for files the user never touches and violates *Cost tracks the actively observed set*.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/LanguageClient.ts:169` (`openDocument` returns early for
unsupported paths, else schedules `ensureStarted`); `:352` (`ensureStarted` is the sole start
gate); `:498` (semantic requests reach `ensureStarted` via `transportFor`).

**Impossible if true:** A spawned language server while every open document is unsupported and no
semantic command has run.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "not started until a supported document"` and
`bun test src/modules/lsp -t "semantic command with no prior openDocument"`.

**Status:** provisional

**Last refined:** 2026-07-21

### Client disposal releases the server

**Invariant:** If a `LanguageClient` is disposed, then its subprocess is killed and its transport
is closed, leaving no orphan process, no live reader, and a terminal `disposed` status — even if
the protocol shutdown handshake is slow or fails.

**Scope:** `LanguageClient.dispose`, `LspTransport.dispose`, `LspProcess.dispose`, and the
supersede paths in `activate` when a newer generation or disposal races an in-flight start.

**Mechanism:** Stands on *A referenced resource stays alive* (a subprocess retains its cost until
explicitly killed). Dispose attempts a bounded `shutdown`/`exit` handshake, then unconditionally
disposes the transport (cancel reader, reject pending) and the process (end stdin, kill child).
The client owns no `$watch` effects, so no `$stopEffects()` is called — that would clear the
cached getter cells and discard the terminal `disposed` status.

**Generates:** The unconditional kill-after-handshake ordering; idempotent `dispose`; the
generation guard that disposes a superseded process/transport created by a racing `activate`.

**Rejected alternatives:** Relying on the protocol `shutdown` handshake alone — a slow or crashed
server would then leak the child process.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/LanguageClient.ts:322` (`process?.dispose()` runs unconditionally
after the guarded handshake); `src/modules/lsp/LspProcess.ts:122` (`child?.kill()`);
`src/modules/lsp/LspTransport.ts:97` (`reader.cancel()` on dispose).

**Impossible if true:** A live subprocess or an un-cancelled stdout reader after `dispose()`
resolves; a disposed client whose status reads anything other than `disposed`.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "dispose kills the subprocess"`.

**Status:** provisional

**Last refined:** 2026-07-21

### Server failures remain contained

**Invariant:** If the language server is absent, slow, or crashes, then the failure surfaces only
as observable optional-service state (`unavailable`/`error`, empty results); it never throws
across the client boundary into editor input or document mutation.

**Scope:** Provider resolution, process spawn, transport start, every semantic request, and the
transport-close/crash path. The whole public surface of `LanguageClient`.

**Mechanism:** Stands on *Language and git tools are separate failable processes* and generates
*The immediate layer never blocks the deferred layer*. A failed spawn returns `false` plus
`error` rather than throwing; each semantic method wraps its request in try/catch and returns a
neutral value (`null`/`[]`) via `containFailure`; a mid-session crash routes through the
transport `onClose` handler that resets state without rethrowing.

**Generates:** `setUnavailable` for missing servers; `containFailure` for in-flight faults;
`handleTransportClose` for crashes; neutral return values from `definition`/`references`/`hover`.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/LspProcess.ts:93` (`start` catches and returns `false`);
`src/modules/lsp/LanguageClient.ts:375` (`setUnavailable` on no server); `:441` (`activate`
catch → `containFailure`); `:244`/`:268`/`:287` (semantic requests catch → return neutral).

**Impossible if true:** An editor keystroke or buffer mutation that throws or blocks because an
LSP is missing, slow, or has died.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "missing server executable degrades to unavailable"`.

**Status:** provisional

**Last refined:** 2026-07-21

### Diagnostic updates match current revisions

**Invariant:** If a `publishDiagnostics` batch is applied to a document, then its version equals
both the document's current revision and the version last synced to the server; a batch naming
any other version is discarded, never applied.

**Scope:** `applyDiagnostics`. Diagnostics for a document whose text has advanced past the batch's
version, or that was never opened/synced.

**Mechanism:** Stands on *An async result can outlive the state it described* and generates
*Async results are revision-stamped and stale results discarded*. The client stamps every
`didOpen`/`didChange` with the document revision; a returning batch is accepted only when its
`version` matches both the live revision and the last-sent version, so a batch computed against
stale text is dropped.

**Generates:** The exact-version guard in `applyDiagnostics`; revision stamping on document sync;
per-URI diagnostic batches keyed by version.

**Rejected alternatives:** Applying whatever diagnostics arrive last — an older batch would then
overwrite diagnostics for newer text, the exact failure *Async results are revision-stamped*
forbids.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/LanguageClient.ts:547` (`state.document.revision.value !== version
|| state.lastSentVersion !== version` → discard); `:540` (`applyDiagnostics`).

**Impossible if true:** A stored diagnostic whose `version` is older than the document revision it
is shown against.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "stored only for the current document revision"`.

**Status:** provisional

**Last refined:** 2026-07-21

### Diagnostic storage stays compact and bounded

**Invariant:** If diagnostics are held for a document, then they are stored as plain
non-reactive records in a per-URI map and capped at `maxDiagnosticsPerDocument`, so storage
scales with the configured bound, not with whatever count the server emits.

**Scope:** The `diagnosticBatches` store and every read/ingest path (`applyDiagnostics`,
`diagnosticSlice`). Not the reactive revision signal, which is a single sparse counter.

**Mechanism:** Stands on *Cost tracks the actively observed set*. Ground truth is a
`Map<uri, {version, items}>` of compact records; a single `diagnosticsRevision` ref signals
change. Ingest slices the incoming array to the cap, and reads clamp their window to it, so a
pathological server cannot inflate memory or reactive fan-out.

**Generates:** The compact `LanguageDiagnostic` record; the single coarse `diagnosticsRevision`
signal instead of a ref per diagnostic; the ingest and read caps.

**Rejected alternatives:** One reactive object per diagnostic — reintroduces the per-item
reactivity cost *Cost tracks the actively observed set* rejects.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/lsp/LanguageClient.ts:103` (`diagnosticBatches` plain `Map`); `:550`
(ingest `.slice(0, maxDiagnosticsPerDocument)`); `:211` (read window clamped to the cap).

**Impossible if true:** A document holding more than `maxDiagnosticsPerDocument` stored
diagnostics, or a reactive object allocated per diagnostic.

**Verification:** `bun test src/modules/lsp -t "capped at maxDiagnosticsPerDocument"`.

**Status:** provisional
